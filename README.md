# 🧠 CTF Writeups by Etmeseh

A structured collection of Capture The Flag (CTF) and cybersecurity lab write-ups — built to document, reproduce, and learn from security challenges efficiently.

This repository combines technical accuracy with clarity: each write-up walks through the full exploitation lifecycle, from **enumeration to privilege escalation**, and concludes with lessons learned and remediation insights.  
Additionally, it includes helper scripts and automation tools that simplify repetitive lab tasks.

## 🎯 Goals

- 📄 **Comprehensive Documentation:** Every challenge is written in a standardized, educational format.  
- 🧩 **Reproducibility:** Anyone should be able to follow the steps and replicate the result.  
- ⚙️ **Automation:** Small shell utilities (like `set-target.sh`) reduce manual setup time.  
- 🔐 **Ethical Focus:** All labs are authorized CTF or sandboxed environments — never real-world unauthorized systems.  
- 🧭 **Continuous Learning:** Build a living archive of cybersecurity techniques for personal and professional growth.
